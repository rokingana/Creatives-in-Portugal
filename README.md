### Creative in Portugal 2021

[Netfly App Deploy](https://creatives-in-portugal-2021.netlify.app/)

React project created from data taken from a inquery that was conducted by [Sofia Rocha e Silva](https://www.luscofia.com/) from 26 November 2020 to 26 January 2021.

The data compiled by Sofia, was previously manualy formated by me, and uploaded to this data base [Gist](https://gist.github.com/rokingana/5e2e17ebad29bc73d306adf99ce871db). 691 out of 729 responses were used in this visualization.

The map db is available at [Map Gist - Portugal Continental](https://gist.github.com/rokingana/c55ab0bbbc92c1d16aba84242628dd0b).

### Next Steps

There are a lot of things I want to do, but for starters:

1. Add the interactive legend to Global position
   The interactive legend is associated only to the Scatterplot Graphic because it was the first graphit I did.
   I would like to make it global, so the interaction afects both graphics.

2. Styles
   Change color scheme.
